To achive this with Mac I use ping -c 10 domain 
stddev= standart deviation of RTT
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
oslomet.no
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 32.434/32.844/33.131/0.216 ms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ox.ac.uk
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 20.745/20.975/21.150/0.119 ms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
gaia.cs.umass.edu
10 packets transmitted, 0 packets received, 100.0% packet loss
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
sydney.edu.au
round-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 279.025/279.516/279.693/0.241 ms
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here it show the most efficient rate was in ox.ac.uk with the min RTT 20.745, this can be due higher amount 
of students and universities implementing several hops and switches that make the connection significantly faster.
The package loss can be due routing issue or non configure, or blocking the ping search as this are possible 
also in every mac machine, gaia.cs.umass.edu are reachable on browser.
in sydney.edu.au this could be depending on the geografical distance as the data need to transfer and therfore impact
minmumm round tripe time.
